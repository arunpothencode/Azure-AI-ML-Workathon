These earrings are on their way back to Amazon.\n\nI also wasn't thrilled to see how much the price has varied.  When I ordered--4/6/07--they were $34.99.  Some reviewers bought them for less, yet the current price seems to be even more.\n\nCaveat Emptor"

The post does not stay in place very well.  I am frustrated because I put these on my wish list because they are advertised as having an \"innovative clasp\" which avoids lost earings.  But they did not work well for me.    \nBy the way, after I first wrote this review, I called Amazon to complain.  They sent me another pair right away at no charge.  This suggests to me that others have complained in the past.  I appreciate that they were so responive."

I thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches, rather than paying $10 each time to have a professional do it. I was so disappointed in this tool. The link remover only pushes the pins out halfway. You are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way. As you can imagine this is not easy. My husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out. Knowing what I know now, I would definitely have invested in a different link remover"

It arrived with the one-page instruction sheet wrapped around the plastic tool.  The silver knob that you can see on the left side of this \"tool\" was rusted and would not turn very easily.  I'm not sure how this tool is effective in removing stubborn watch band pins.  Maybe this tool is effective in only removing pins from cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item.  When I attempted to use it, the entire plastic body would flex and I was afraid that it would snap if I twisted the knob any further.  Not worth the sale price that it was advertised.  The most effective way of using it was to remove the knob and pin from the apparatus and gently tap the end with a hammer in order to loosen the pins.  This is definitely not worth the sale price"

If anthing because of the gold plating and the mens watch being much larger, it would cost more to make the mens watch. More size, more gold, more gold, higher price to make. Another little thing that bothers me is both watches are shown together with a little \"better together\" hook. Better for who? There is not once cent in discount for buying together.\n\nI own an Invicta and have had no trouble with it. I would buy the pair for my wife and I. But, I am not going to toss out an extra $35.99 for the womens watch just because Invicta and/or amazon feel they can charge more for if anything a product that would not cost as much to make.\n\nMan, it seems that the women would really get hot over this"

I expected low quality stones with some particles visable to the naked eye. What i didn't expect was the cloudiness. Although these weren't yellow in color they were the absolute worst pair of diamonds i had ever seen. There was  no clarity just two milky looking stones. These diamonds should have been grinded and used for diamond dust or chips only"

However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.\nSo I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me"

She was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived, but as others have noted, these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount (almost 1/4 inch) which makes them rather top heavy. Unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes, these earrings are going to droop downwards, not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect. Needless to say, my moms ear lobes are very thin, as soon as she put them in her ears, they drooped downward at a 45 degree angle. She was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund"

The picture on-line makes it look beautiful with light shining thru the amethyst (ha, looks like cut glass not real amethyst!)/Even putting it up to the natural light it looked dull/fake/plastic.  I emailed and got a reply I would get a full discount just mail it back.  Well, I mailed it back with insurance costing $6.55 after already paying shipping to have it sent to me.  Because I feel it was NOT advertised in a 'correct light' I asked for my shipping back for both charges and disputed the charge with my credit card company.  The refund from Amazon was only the cost of the necklace with neither shipping charge.  I am still going to dispute the the shipping charges because this jewelry did NOT look like it did on the website"

At the time I thought he was just po'd because I didnt buy the watch at the store.  As soon as I was home though the bracelet fell apart.  What a piece of junk!

Seiko refused t oreplace it but said they would repair it and have it back to me in 3-4 weeks! Had I purchased it from a REPUTABLE local store I could have exchanged it for a new watch."

I now can come forward with my negative experience with the Seiko Black Monster too after seeing a handful of other ex-owners post theirs. I had my Seiko Black Monster SKX779K1 for about three weeks when it also did a freeze of all its movements and sounds. No sweep motion, no tick-tock of any sort. But unlike someone else's experience, mine never sprang to life anymore. AFter I shook it gently sideways to wind it up, its second hand moved for only about 10-12 seconds then stopped again. I did this \"Watch CPR\" several times but still always failed to resucitate it. My watch also was forming a light miss on the inside of its crystal a day after I used in while doing the dishes of all things. This is a divers watch? I already packed it up last Thursday for return and dropped it off at my local USPS, and Im still thinking whether to give it a chance and get another Black Monster or to get an entirely different model or brand. I must day that I am DISAPPOINTED BIG TIME in this watch! I loved the way it looked and it really made me felt bad to return it. But to me a watch is an instrument first, an accessory only second."

This watch band is neither innovative nor thoughtful in its design. \n\nI don't even want to wear this watch. I really don't think I should have to buy a new watch band for my brand new watch.\n\nFurthermore, Timex customer service is like dealing with a bunch of idiots. It is as if they read about 2 words of your email and then reply. I guess they think that if they keep feeding you stupid answers long enough, you'll eventually go awa"

Good quality earring for a young teenager (9 to 14 years old) but not for the woman I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. Returning the earring and definitely learned my lesson - Jewelry has to been seen and bought with your \"own\" eyes and not through fancy \"photoshop\" website with touchup/enhanced photos"

I'd upgrade at least one more star, maybe two if I could.\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy son wanted to buy mama's present this Christmas so naturally, we turned to Amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily.  \n\nThe earrings arrived today (very quickly) but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts.  The stone is white, like a fake diamond.  When viewed in other kinds of light, you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture.  \n\nAnother issue - the clasp or ear stud is flimsy.  I may return them (need to ask my son) but I don't think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears.\n\nOn the positive side - it really is a nice design"

The crystal subsequently cracked due to temperature changes. The elegant design of a thin gold rim holding the crystal cannot stand large rapid temperature differences. I went to my local jeweler who was very familiar with the crystal issue with Skagen watches. I called Skagen, seems they are aware of this problem too. However the only option offered was to send the watch back for repair -pay $25.00 for repair of the crystal, pay $8.95 for s&h and then pay insurance and return postage. As I paid $65.00 for the watch I consider this a total ripoff. I would not buy another product from Skagen and recommend that Amazon discontinue selling any Skagen products until they become a responsible corporate partner. It is a pretty watch and seemed like a good deal - but it is not turning out that way. Or you can buy this watch and only wera it in warm climates"

To avoid problems with my reenergized time piece, I decided to invest in a winder.  After comparing online prices and reading dozens of reviews, I thought I had found a reasonably priced solution to keep my Seiko moving.  This winder does everything it's supposed to do (spin, stop, reverse, etc.) but can't provide sufficient motion to activate the charging mechanism inside my heavyweight watch.  Unfortunately, my kinetic may have made it's final sweep around the dial.  On the bright side, I now have a winder that I can only hope does a better job with my NEXT automatic watch"

I may change my review later if I find this is all due to operator error, but at this point three well educated people have been unable to figure it out. At the very least there is a problem with either ease of use or documentation. \n\nIn the Fitness Sensor User Guide there are pieces listed that are not in my box. However, the web page does not mention them. I suspect the guide is an older version. If not, perhaps there has been a shipping error. In any case, I am not happy."

X-mas morning after my young daughter open her gift I more closely examined them.  One of the earrings was completely grayish in color; so dark that I would consider it to be defective.  I called the Netaya customer service phone number only to be greeted with \"Hello\".  After verifying that I had indeed reached Netaya I briefly explained the defect and requested that I be permitted to return the earrings.  I was placed on hold and then told that \"the lady\" I needed to speak with was busy and I would need to call back or send an e-mail.  I e-mailed the company twice before receiving notice that they would not accept the return because 30 days had passed since purchase.  I would not recommend"

This watch I have now will not allow me to go more than five days without the solar battery running out - usually at inopportune times where I really need a watch!  It has become very unpredictable.  Please do not get me wrong, it is a nice watch, I have gotten many favorable comments.  But I want a watch I trust to work day-in, day-out and not one I am constantly worried about.  I guess for someone who has the time to set the thing out in the sun on a regular basis, it would be a good purchase"

However, I was very disappointed in this item--perhaps my own fault for failing to notice that no dimensions were given in the item description.  I wrongly assumed that the charm would be approximately the size of my thumbnail, and was surprised when it arrived and I could barely find it in the tiny blue velvet bag that contained it.  It is miniscule--1 cm long x 1/2 cm wide!  The enamel is applied unevenly, and though the charm is tiny, it is evident that the enamel is thicker in some places, and contains air bubbles in others.  It might be cute on a charm bracelet with a purse or shopping theme, but would not work as a pendant, as I had intended.  I'm sending it back for a refund"

However, it took about 18 months for the band to break, and then less than 2 years for the watch to completely die. The solar charger slowly quit working - at first I just couldn't set the hands on the watch because it was stuck in \"recover\" mode, but the digital display was still correct so it was still somewhat usable. Then after a few months of this, everything went blank. I sent it off to Casio expecting a quick, inexpensive repair (or even a free repair, as I expected them to stand behind their product). Shortly thereafter, I received a repair estimate for $94.11 - more than the watch currently sells for brand new! So...in my opinion, the watch is probably worth the $69.00 that it currently sells for, but don't expect it to last more than a year or two. I won't be buying another Casio"

The previous watch had been repaired 2 times earlier, and unfortunately every time I got it back from COSERV, it would be less and less accurate, thus I decide to get a new one.  The new one was made in Maylasia vs Japan (I have read on this site that one needs to be concerned about that), and was lighter in weight, but kept time well for about one week.  I bumped the watch on a table (nothing severe, the previous watch endured much more) and it immediately started gaining more than 10 minutes per hour.  I had high hopes that this watch would at least meet, and hopely exceed the durability of the previous watch, but it did not make it passed one week of casual wear.  I returned it in disappointment"

When my digital home thermometer marks 72 F, the watch marks 92 F so if you want an accurate measure you need to take it off, and wait between 20min and 30min to reach an accurate measure (This information was extracted from the Manual). \n\nSo in conclusion, if you want a watch with a thermometer built-in... just keep looking for other models."

The green dial is a pale lime green, not too bright.  Everything was going good until yesterday when I noticed the watch seemed to have stopped working (and this is only after 2 weeks of having it!!).  I reset the time and it started ticking again, so I thought it was just a fluke.  Now it is working sometimes but is generally running slow (the time keeps falling farther behind).  If this is a battery problem already I am very disappointed that amazon would send out a new watch with an old battery.  I expect to take this up with them, as obtaining a new battery isn't very easy because there isn't a fossil store nearby.  In the manual it says to mail in the watch for a new battery, which costs $15!!  How inconvenient.  I am not impressed"

However, the setting is so deep and so bulky that when the earrings are on, you can't see the sparkle of the stones.   If the setting was daintier and the stones had more color, these would look great.   But as they are, the earrings look like blobs, not tanzanite."

It seemed daunting to work the features at forst, but a short time with the instruction book made them accessable and easy.\n\nI have only two complaints: One is that the metal band has developed a slight \"squeak\" when I move my wrist sometimes. The tin man needs oil. The second is that despite being placed by a huge window every night, the watch does not always get the time signal from Ft. Collins. I have gone as long as several days without getting it - but when you consider that most watches do not get it at all, I am OK with the spotty reception"

The watch charges easily - put it under a light when you take it off- and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source (i.e. it's dark).  The buttons/settings work similarly to a battery powered G-shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right.  It's the first Casio I've owned with a metal band.  Unless you're a gorilla, You'll need to remove some links from the watch band.  I did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools.  I love the watch.  It is everything you would expect from a G-Shock"

      "date": "June 9, 2006",
      "reviewer": "Kiyo M.",
      "reviewer_location": "You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted",
      "review_text": "The strap/links on these G-Shocks are quite oversized: when I first got it, I could fit the watch around my legs! (You'll most likely have to get the links adjusted). Ironically, the four side buttons on the watch is small. So even if you have a huge wrist, you'll probably have trouble pressing the buttons! (Not for huge fingers) \n\n***BEWARE*** the picture shows the four side buttons on the watch in silver, but the left and right side buttons on this model is actually plain black! It is quite misleading! The silver side button is actually the MTG920DJ model (which is the 2005 version). According to Casio, the MTG920DA was actually released in 2004 with black side buttons. If you search the Casio website, it will only display the MTG920DJ (their most recent version); most websites that still sell the MTG920DA are just taking the latest MTG920DJ version picture from Casio's website. The MTG920DJ seems to have the same features as this one (MTG920DA), except the four side (left and right) buttons are in silver. \n\nFor those of you wondering about the three circles on the watch: \nthe first one on the very left is basically a wannabe-analog display - basically, every five minutes, a bar increases (or decreases when it gets full); it's just mostly there for cosmetic reasons. \n\nThe second one in the middle is the battery status; it has an L (Low), M (Medium), and H (High) and the bar would display in one of those areas. If you get out in the sun a lot or know an area in your home where the sun shines a lot, then you won't have a problem with the battery ever going below High. Moreover, it has a power saving feature; the watch will go into sleep mode (display off) when it is in a completely dark area for a long time. \n\nFinally, the third circle on the very right is where it tells you what options are enabled/disabled. It shows SPL (split time for stopwatch), DST (Daylight Saving Time), SIG (Hourly Signal), ALM (Alarm), SNZ (Snooze), and Auto EL (Automatic Electro-Luminescent backlight - the backlight turns on by tilting it a certain degree towards your face without having to manually press the backlight button.) \n\nKeep in mind, synchronizing with the atomic signal is not instant: it usually takes around 3 minutes (at least for me, I live in California.) And if you're in a busy area or near an electronic, it might be difficult; try again or move to a different area. Moreover, it should show you the strength/level (4 levels) of the signal (while you're synchronizing) with a satellite icon on the watch. There is also a feature that automatically synchornizes for you while you're sleeping at 2:00AM, 3:00AM, 4:00AM, and 5:00AM. Therefore, it's not always necessary to syncronize it yourself because by the time you wake up, it should be ready to go. \n\nOverall, this watch is attractive and fun to wear. The atomic radio signal feature is very cool; having the official time is great - right to the precise second! I've had this watch for months now, and I enjoy wearing it daily. \n\nThis watch does have a lot of feature - except, it's a pity it does ***NOT*** have a countdown timer! \n\nPros: \n- Cool design \n- Water/scratch resistant; G-Shock are known for their toughest watches. (Update: I've worn this watch daily for almost a year and a half now and not a single scratch - still looks brand new!)\n- Solar Power; battery life is excellent; never had the power ever go below High. Power Saving Feature. \n- Position of the time and date is easy to read at one glance. \n- Metal strap \n- Can display World Time with Local Time \n\nCons: \n- The side buttons are small and tight to press (must use like the very tip of the fingers) \n- Atomic signal takes too long manually, and it usually is not possible to synchronize while wearing the watch; if you're inside the home, it is usually best to take off the watch and leave it near a window. \n- Alarm beep can be a little longer perhaps (even my inexpensive Timex Watch would beep and it would gradually beep faster, which I actually like a bit better.) \n- No countdown timer. (How could they forget this?!) \n\nAlso, try to research other models instead of finding out the hard way (like I did about the side buttons) before purchidg."

You could have bought the # GW1400DA-9AV (the stainless steel model) for the same price ($75) during the week of July 24, 2006.\n\nThis watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality: solar power (no need for daily rewinding, kinetic body movement, or batteries), synch with the atomic clock in Colorado (ultimate accuracy), time zone adjustment (ease for jet setters), light button (which also goes off when you tilt your wrist), stop watch functionalities, day/date functionalities, and countless other time-related functions. In this respect, it's much more functional than a Patek (even the complicated wrist watch models, or the more mundane Rolex, etc.). Of course, it's a lowly Casio, costing a mere $75 (vs. $75,000 for a low end complicated Patek)\n\nBuyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky, probably 5/8 to 3/4 in. thick. One needs a sporty forearm/wrist to go with this watch.\n\nFor the fun of wearing it couple times a year, the price, and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches, I'd highly recommend it."

My mother bought this bracelet for me at the age of 21 as a surprise (after some hinting; I was patiently waiting to buy it on my own!) I must say it is one of the most beautiful and meaningful gifts anyone has ever given to me. I don't believe I have taken it off for a single day in the several months I've owned it; it fits perfectly, matches everything and its beautiful message keeps me more centered and hopeful. It also keeps me feeling close to my mother while I'm away at college. She doesn't know it yet, but I hope to buy her the same bracelet for Christmas. It's a simply amazing gift for yourself or someone else"

The reason they lose a star with me is that for the 7mm size, the earring backs should be larger; they are on the small side"

Common complaints included scratches on the face, atomic synching problems, and difficulty setting up the watch for the first time.\n\nI received my watch and it was in perfect condition, no scratches, light or otherwise.  It is light but the construction feels solid.  I was wondering what the initial setup was going to be like, since others had claimed it had taken hours(!!!).  It literally took me 15 seconds.  It involves holding a button down for 5 seconds, and pressing the other button a few times.  Once it was set up, the watch immediately synched itself to my local time with no problems at all  (I live in central Florida.)  I've only owned the watch for a day now and I must say I'm impressed with it so far.  I haven't experienced any troubles mentioned in the other reviews, and I'm very satisfied with my purchase.  Also, I chose the Super Saver shipping, Amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks to get it to me.  I received it in 4 days"

Perhaps only the fratricidal dispute between boxers and briefs has more violently bloodied the masculine nose of our generation than this battle. Yet the jury remains out: wallet or money clip, what'll it be?\n\nLives and careers are savaged by a choice of one over the other, yet the passion that drives guys in the direction of the traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - to the minimalist money clip continues unabated.\n\nThe Titanium Money Clip scores a victory for the latter. Small, lightweight, attractive, it cleans a hip pocket out, straightens the hang of the trouser, and facilitates the quick snatch of a bill when the wallet guys are still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved in with their banknotes.\n\nThe only complaint regarding this product is that it requires five or six bills, minimum, before it has a sufficient wad to clasp firmly.\n\nOther than that ... well ... I can't even remember where I tossed my wallet"

It seems no more likely to do that than any other money clip, which is to say, maybe it eventually will, or maybe it won't, them's the risks of life. Go for it"

The Yin looks a lot better with a little silver shining through the paint, however, but I do worry about all of the paint eventually going away.

They are not large hoops; if fact, they are a bit small -- but perfect for her. For an adult, I think a little bit larger size would be better. All in all, I was very pleased with the earrings; the quality is very good."

To quote the cons, it IS a bit chunky, but that's ok since I'm using it as a casual watch. The back of the watch is plastic, which makes it look cheap but don't know if there is any specific reason for that. Also it would've gratified my every needs, had there been an 'Indiglo' or 'Nightglo' feature. In complete darkness, the irradiating hands look fine, but if it is half light, then I have to spend a second or two searching for the hands. These are minor things and I am a perfectionist, so here I stamp 4 stars on it."

The silver band looks great and my husband liked it, but for work he has to have a non-metal band. We replaced the band with a plastic/rubber one, and the watch is still looking great, and my husband can use it for work or dressy situations!  \n\nI can't believe the great price we got this watch for.

And because it's not an expansion braclet, it's very easy to adjust the band to fit your wrist. I hope to have this for years to come, because I've not seen anything like it.

I bought it because it was titanium mesh, not because of it's latching method. Again its almost 18th century... it's 21 century material used in place of a 18th Century design"

I read some other reviews on other watches and was cautious when some said that they purchased watches that were not in boxes and had no instructions.  This watch arrived three days after I ordered it and was in a beautiful box just like I had bought at the store. It was brand new and I love it.  I especially love it when I get something new on sale and a great deal.  Amazon is a great place to order.  I get merchandise very quickly and at a great price"

The mesh band is the most comfortable band you will ever wear, you don't even feel it against your skin. I have a two-tone Movado and I far prefer my $89 Skagen to my $900 Movado.  My Skagen is also easy to read the time. I just love it more than I can say. I own numerous watches, many from Switzerland. But the Skagen is the KING of my lifetime watch collection.

The moon phase is nice to know about and the sunrise and sunset is pretty cool too, but I didn't give this watch 5 stars because for the money it didn't give me the one option I used more than any other on previous cheaper watches, a timer.  This one has the stopwatch but there is no timer you can set for say 10 or 15 minutes.  It keeps great time so far, but that's typical of Casio.  The backlight is very bright, enough so that you can almost use it as a flashlight, and the option on this model where you can set it for the backlight to come on everytime you hold your arm a certain way is cool.  If you're looking for a good water proof timepiece and you don't really care about the timer issue, this is the one.  And yeah I'm vain about what it looks like on my arm; it looks manly and cool"

In addition to having glow-in-the-dark markings (which don't work too well) on the hands and dial-markers, it also has an Indiglo style back-light (which does work well).  The bezel only rotates counter-clockwise, and it seems very tight at first.  Overall, it's a decent everyday watch."

I took it to a professional jewelry repair shop, and they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches.  I would recommend having any size adjustments done by a professional jeweler who has been selling this brand of watch for a while.  The jeweler I went to has a good reputation, but does not sell Skagen."

      "review_text": "The Casio G-Shock Atomic Solar Watch #GW1400DA-4AV is sort of middle of the road in terms of price (I paid $99). It's not cheap but it's not too expensive either. The display diameter is not large but it is a thick, tough-looking watch (a real man's watch... :) ). It's also on the heavy side. So, if you're looking for an elegant, thin watch, look somewhere else.\n\nWhen I first got it, the power source was at 50% charge. After leaving the watch on my desk facing up towards a desk fluorescent lamp that was left on, the charge reached 100% the next day. The solar cell seems to be working. The time is accurate too. I checked it against the computer time (which also gets synched everyday). It comes with a small manual (with very small text), but I found that there's really no need to use the manual at all initially. It works right out of the box and all the factory settings were correct. (The manual will come in useful when you have some time on your hands to browse through it to get a clearer idea of all the available features.)\n\nThe watch's steel wristband was much too large for me and I had to shorten it (removed 4 links, actually). I used a Swiss army knife blade to accomplish the task. The knife tip has to be strong enough to apply pressure to the spring loaded rod that holds the links together, but small to get into the small area between the wrist band metal links (watch for the arrows: these tell you where to apply the pressure). You need to push down on the ridges of the rod, and out (away from you). (Down, so that you can make the rod shorter, and out so that when the rod is shortened, the wrist band link will pop out). I did accidentally scratch the band but it wasn't too bad since the scratch was on the inside. (It's easy enough to shorten the wristband and almost everyone who gets this watch will have to do this.) Be careful not to slice your finger open. Always turn the blade away from your finger when applying the pressure.\n\nOverall, I give it 2 thumbs up for looks and functionality.\n\n(Note: this watch is sold by multiple vendors on Amazon. You should check for the one that has the best price. When I bought it, I wasn't aware of this but found out later, a little too late)"

However, this is partly due to its enormous thickness. It's not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large - it's how thick it is. If you have a small wrist, this watch is probably not for you, as it will be very noticeable. It's also not especially light, obviously, but it feels comfortable enough.\n\nIt keeps excellent time, and I've had no problems with the automatic signal searching"

      "review_text": "This watch is great. It recharges itself, self adjusts with the atomic clock, world time, auto lighting, etc... just to mention a few features. As this is from the G shock series, it is really sturdy and scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant! It has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time(whichever is convenient). This synchronizes with the atomic clock(time and the daylight savings) which means you need not adjust the time. Another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time!\n\nThere are a few cons. There is no seconds hand on it(but there is a digital second indicator). This watch is slightly heavy and huge. But after a few months you get adjusted to it. You need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons"

I like the dial, features, (changes to dst, calendar knows how many days in a month,etc.)   Do not, though, travel with this watch for a while without the instruction book.   The four control buttons take some time to figure out, and most of them are so rarely used that when you do need the stopwatch, or one of the various other options, you'll likely need the book (at least I did).  Also understand that this is a BIG watch--probably at least twice as thick as the watch you're used to and considerably heavier.  It will hang up on a jacket or anything with long sleeves.   The G shock, though, is tougher than a hammer and if you don't mind the bulk I'd recommend it.  RLM in Iow"

I get compliments on it, especially from women, almost EVERY SINGLE DAY.  Several of my older colleagues mistook it for a Rolex Daytona and flipped when I told them the price.  I highly recommend it.\n\nFurthormore,  I have found that INVICTA is an amazing watch company to say the least.  Around the same time I also bought the 8926 Pro Diver to use as my casual watch and also get endless compliments.  It is amazing that I got both of these watches for less money than a run of the mill Seiko or Citizen.  They will have have my money and compliments for years to come"

It survived the hardships of an Army lifestyle (I wore it daily then, too) and is still going strong.  I have replaced the battery once and had to have the date bezel removed (the thin silver border) because it popped out after my toddler daughter beat on it on the ground various times (yes, I should have moved it to a higher location).  The lens has minor scratches, but nothing that deters from its simple function and aesthetic charm.  This watch has never failed me.  It is simply the best, most durable, watch that I have ever owned"

If you're average size or smaller, I wouldn't recommend it.  Personally, this is my weekend watch because it comes across as being pretty bullet-proof in normal use"

I found that I was carrying a whole lot of \"stuff\" in my wallet that I didn't need and was just causing my wallet to get bigger and bigger.\n\nWith just 5 cards, a couple receipts and a little cash this clip is much more comfortable, easier to manage, and looks a lot better than my old wallet.\n\nI do agree with the previous reviewer about the clip forcing the cash to bunch up under the clasp when it's closed.  However, it doesn't take long for it to become second nature to keep the cash pulled out a bit before securing it down.\n\nI haven't used any other money clips so I can't compare this one to others, but if you use a wallet I can say that this is, hands down, my new preference"

      "review_text": "I've had this for a week, it may not function as well in a year, and that is something you might want to keep in mind reading this.\n\nSo far, however, it's been a great replacement for a wallet. Don't get me wrong, I still have my wallet and will likely use it when travelling. But for everyday use this is far more practical and comfortable to carry. It's also as easy on the eyes as it is in the pocket - equally pleasant to carry and look at.\n\nFeels sturdy and durable; light but not flimsy. This can hold upto 5 cards and maybe 20 bill notes.\n\nBe warned, however, although the clip does hold 5 credit card-sized cards (ID's, and whatever else you may have) it is only really easy to remove the topmost and bottom most cards. That is, if you have 5 cards you use quite often you may want to look else where.\n\nPersonally, I have an ID on the top and my credit card on the bottom. The other three cards are ones I almost never use, or use very rarely.\n\nOne of the concerns I had purchidg this is whether or not it will securly hold less than 5 cards. It does (there are pressure clips on the sides of where the card goes in), but I wouldn't recommend it. Just didn't feel safe enough, even with 4 cards.\n\nSomething I did not foresee purchidg this is that the clip secures the money very tightly. Consequently: 1) When you press down the clip, it drags the money back a few millimeters. If you put the money in too far back it'll crumple it up. 2) When secured, you can't just pull out a bill, you will have to lift the clip up. The first point I've found a little more bothersome than the second, but after playing around with it for half an hour or so I've got the hang of clamping it without crumpling the money.\n\nThat being said, it really is a very nice item and would be an awesome gift to give to a friend, husband, father, or for your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style.\n\n(If you are wondering why it is a 4 star and not a 5... well, for no real good reason. It does deserve 5 stars, but the little issues with the clip tugging on the money as you clamp it down - although it means money is held more securely - that holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure, and pulling out any card other than the top and bottom most cards is difficult, dropped it down to a 4. It may just be that these are issues that were neccessary to keep the product as fanatastic as it is. 4.5 stars might have been a welcome option, this is as close to perfect as it gets."

The case is a bit thick and the backplate is plastic, but that might reduce overall weight and compensate for the size. It certainly doesn't feel like the lead weight my fossil watches seem to be. I have a smaller than average wrist and it was easily sizable down with the proper tools. Atomic time reception is good even as far south as I am and it rarely misses updates. You can force an update if you feel like it and its really easy.  What is not easy is the initial setup.  I've never had to really read a manual on most electronics, but you will need it with this one.  Keep that in a safe place for when the battery dies.  At least for now, the price is a deal for the functionality and quality"

This is the most expensive watch I have ever had, I have always worn Timex, but no more. The features in the Perpetual Calendar and the Kinetic and it also has a Leap Year Calendar, which I did not need, but no problem. If the watch sets still for more than 12 hours it actually stops. Then the moment you pick it back up it automatically reset's itself, pretty cool feature. When I received it, the watch blew me away. It was delivered quickly and tags were attached and I registered it with [....................]. I can go on........I give it 10 stars if it would let me!!!!! Enjoy."

So I can go sometimes a full week without wearing it.  The hands stop after sitting still for 24 hours but as soon as I pick it back up and give it a shake, the hands spin around and sets itself.  Its not to dressy for casual wear, but it also fits perfectly with a suit and tie. I highly recommend it!"

      "review_text": "First impressions: It's a nice watch with a clear look. I was a little worried about the lack of backlighting, but was pleasantly suprised that I was able to see the luminescent dials clearly at any hour of the night.\n\nPros: Quick atomic time synchronization (usually within one to two minutes after the initial synchronization). Simple to use. \n\nCons: Case is described as stainless steel, but back piece is plastic. Originally listed by Amazon as a solar-powered watch, but instead powered by regular battery. Battery life expectancy about 2 years, though it may lost longer by disabling the auto-sync feature.\n\nOverall comments: This is my first atomic time wrist-watch. It automatically synchronizes with atomic time once at midnight (a function you can disable if desired) or on-demand with the press of a button or two. It does this by scanning for a radio signal. According to the instructions, you're supposed to leave this watch near a window with the 6-o'clock side facing the window for best radio-signal reception. Reception can of course vary depending on your location, but the watch has successfully updated several times even while I was wearing it.\nI like watches with flat crystal surfaces, because it allows me to paste a PDA screen-proctector (cut to size, of course) on them, which keeps the crystal from scratching. The crystal on this watch is only slightly curved, and in only one direction, meaning a screen protector sticks nicely and evenly to it.\nThe watch is waterproof to 50 meters, which (in Casio terms) means you can go swimming with it, but you should not press any buttons underwater. I try to keep my watches away from water when I can, but it's always good to know that it should survive most water-related mishaps"

I'm also worried that the clasp might not hold up to repeated use and wish it was the more traditional link to link closure than this insert-key type clasp. It's probably a great choice for very occassional use, though with the quality and price, it really is a regular-use type of necklace. I think it's best suited for the nimble-fingered, traditional-fashion person"

The box, while attractive at first glance, is flimsy, got slightly crushed in transit, and the ribbon on its top is frayed and pasted-on.  The card that came with it is much too large to fit inside the box or even on top gracefully, and the message inside is not centered, making it impossible to trim down.  Said message inside appears to have been written in plain old Times New Roman script.  I could do far better on my own printer, and for the cost, I could get a much more attractive card at a store.  I will say, however, that the piece itself looks every bit as nice as it does in the photos.  I might order from Silver Insanity again, but I'm not paying for any of the \"frills\"- they just aren't putting enough work into it to make it worth it"

The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute.  As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them.  They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession.  If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item"

It does not seem too thick. It does not appear cheap or lightweight. Although the back plate and two buttons are plastic, the rest of the watch is sturdy metal, and it feels solid. The wristband is just the right size for me, although I do have a gorilla wrist. I didn't find the manual difficult to understand. The watch attempted to auto-sync overnight, but didn't get a signal, so I manually sync'ed it the next day according to the instructions with no problem. Easy-to-read dial, low price (about $35), overall a great atomic watch worth twice what I paid"

It would be nice if it had backlighting, but the hands do glow in the dark for some period of time. It is a little tricky to pick up the time signal so I would recommend finding a place in your home where the signal is strong and leave it there every night."

The size is perfect; very \"in\" right now. You do have to pull on the stem pretty hard to get them off because the clasp is very tight. However, so far, so good. They have not broken and the clasp has not become loose or anything. I even accidentally left them in a pocket once and they were put through the washing machine. They were completely fine afterward. I do wish the earrings had been about $20 less expensive. But, overall I love my earrings"

I purchased it in Cayman Is, and I think I paid a lot more than the Amazon price.\n\nI love the Eco-Drive, as it never needs attention. About a year ago, the Eco-Drive mechanism went bad, and I sent it to Citizen. They replaced the mechanism for free, saying it was their issue. Kudos to them on that.\n\nI have been able to scratch the crystal, but only after heavy abuse :) The number band around the outside still turns as well as the day I bought it. The numbers on the metallic band around the face have never worn off, but the outside of the band has a nice smooth edge to it now. \n\nThe lettering wore off the band after about a year, so if you plan to use the dive table that is on the band, don't wear it daily. Else, be smart and carry your own dive table on the old plastic card or on your dive computer. \n\nThe band has now finally worn out after 5 years (which is how I ended up here). The two small strap holders just broke off in the past 2 weeks (they wore through), and the band is cracking but only in the holes (still holds just fine). \n\nI would buy this watch again, and obviously recommend it."

After going through several cheaper watches to wear at work and on a casual basis I decided to spend a few extra bucks to see if I could get more wear out of one and I am sold on this one.  I work in a facility that deals with chemicals that are hard on watches and I also work with mechanical equipment that is hard on crystals and this watch has held up in my working environment quite well. Because I am not a diver, I am not sure that this is a good diving watch but I do fish and play in the Atlantic and this watch has held up through use in the sand and salt with very little care given to it.  I am still on my first band and battery and the watch still keeps accurate time.  The band is starting to crack a bit but, after what I've put this watch through, I am surprised it has held up this long.  The crystal is a tad bit scratched but the other watches that I have had would have blown apart or would at least be cloudy from the blows that it's taken"

I have enjoyed it for almost two weeks now and it has kept perfect time to date.\n\nOriginally I was attracted to the Seiko SKX173 which I came across first.  However I was concerned that the physical size of the Seiko might be too large for my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not be as accurate as I wanted. \n\nLater I found this Citizen watch which looks virtually identical, yet it is smaller (diameter 38mm vs 43, height 10.5mm vs 13.5), and has a more accurate battery-driven quartz movement.\n\nIt also has a longer warranty (5 years vs 3) which probably indicates that the movement is more likely to be trouble-free than the self-winding Seiko.\n\nThe only negative I have encountered is that it (as well as the Seiko) come with a fairly bulky rubber strap.  While this is more comfortable than I expected, it does tend to interfere somewhat with the drape of the cuff when wearing a long sleeve shirt."

At first, I was a little self conscious about wearing this big thing when I first got it home and tried it on, but come to think of it, it's not that much bigger than my Seiko diver's\n\nI'd highly recommend it.

The only piece of styling I was not happy about was the large magnifier above the date on the watch, which is not visible on the amazon photos. When I pulled out the crown to set the time and date I got that sinking feeling that something wasnt right, and that feeling was followed by the whole crown comming out of the watch.  I was able to put it back in and set the time, but setting the date was not possible.  I used Amazons online return procedure, filling out an HTML entry field box about the problem and printed out postage and a barcode to put in the box.  I took it to the post office and the shipping was free, although the post office was not able to insure the shipment which kind of worried me.  That was 4 days ago and I still havent heard anything from amazon about the return, although they did say expect 5-9 days to process returns.  I hope it all goes well and I get a replacent watch.  I did read about this same problem on other Amazon reviews for similar watches by Invicta, so it is worth looking into before purchidg."

The metal stays shiny, the glass, virtually scratch proof. Days of the week, military time, day of month (problem with this is it does not know, if month is 30 days or 31, so u have to set it yourself sometimes, but rarely, and worth the effort) I highly reccomend this watch to everyone"

The case was also good, and thankfully wasn't just the typical throw away plastic crap.  The inside of the case is firm foam that keeps the tools nicely in place.  The case itself is firm black leather-like  material and snaps closed.  The kit contains a hammer, band holding base, and several different sized pin drivers for removing band pins.  Also includes the clamp type pin remover (the blue thing), a set of screwdrivers and a thin but sturdy wedge for removing watch backs.  All in all I'm quite pleased with the product.

Thus, all atomic watches are always accurate to within a fraction of a second at any time. Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are the ultimate in accurate watches. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, but all are equally accurate. The Casio G-Shock series is especially rugged and the solar powered models, such as this, never require battery replacement. Atomic accurary, solar power, and G-Shock ruggedness is an appealing combination at a quite reasonable price"

This watch is not too big, though it has a pretty thick face, the material looks and feels pretty sturdy.\n\nSetting of the watch is not too difficult, it's similar to other casio watches. I did not have problems getting the hands to match the digital time, it appeared to do it automatially, although i believe you have a feature to intentionally set them out of sync. Radio atomic reception is great, (Austin, Tx). The light is based of two led's on the left and right of the watch face. Although it's not as bright/easy to read as the full illuminator watches that casio/timex has, it sufficiently lights up the screen to read the time, and is quite pretty.\n\nPro's\n-great value, for 79 usd, you get gshock, solar, atomic, metal band\n-as a previous reviewer mentioned, you can remove links from the watch in about 10-15 mins with a sharp tipped knife\n\nCon's\n-A little heavy\n-Digital readout is tiny but adequate (the watch can actually display the current time of day in that tiny circular lcd panel)\n-No countdown timer\n-Alarm is really short and pretty soft, but that seems to be the case of all casio solar watche"

No problems with losing time (wish these things did DST themselves!!!), and date, although somewhat hard to read, does its job.\n\nThe numbers on the dial are easy to read and each one (1...12) are phospholuminescent and easy to read in the dark with normal light exposure.\n\nThe watch isn't heavy, nor is it on the light side for waches like this, and having buttons on the side has proved useful when timing things - sit-up competitions, runs, etc...\n\nOverall very pleased"

      "review_text": "Since I had never purchased a watch by Croton, I did not know what to expect.  The watch came in 2 boxes, the first being a black cardboard box detailing the Croton brand in silver on the top center of the lid.  Inside of this box, the watch itself is encased in a nice padded black leather case with the Croton name embossed on the top center of the lid.  On the inside of the lid, there is a \"pocket\" that stores the instruction guide and a warranty card, which is neatly concealed behind a black piece of material with the Croton logo in silver text.  Needless to say, I will feel good presenting this gift to my boyfriend.\n\nThe watch itself has substance to it.  The shape of the watch face is unique as it looks like a more rounded rectangle. The face is blue, and what is nice is that there is a bit of light texturing on the face.  The blue color seems to change from dark to lighter depending on the lighting in the room.  The numbers are clearly visible, but the date is a bit on the small side, but not terrible.  When I took the watch out of the case, I noticed that it was not running and at first, I feared that the watch battery was dead.  This was not the case however, I found that the watch pin on the side was pulled out, which had stopped the watch.  I am not sure why this was done, perhaps it is done to conserve the watch battery?  \n\nThe back of the watch has the Croton name etched into the center and underneath, it states that it has a sapphire crystal, Japanese quartz movement and the water resistant details. As for the bracelet, it does not seem to be as heavy as I thought it would be, but I will have a better idea after my boyfriend tries it on.  However, I am expecting that he will need to get the watch sized to fit his wrist, but this not at all surprises me as this has been common practice with many of his watches.  As other reviews mention, the instruction booklet is not for this specific watch and is not so helpful.  \n\nAll in all, I think this is a nice watch.  Its design is simple, yet elegant.  I think it will be a good business casual watch, as it can be dressed up for the office, yet be worn after hours and on weekends.  Another nice feature is the fact that it is water resistan"

This not only gave my kids a watch that actually fits, it was fun for them to assemble them, and they are still mixing up the colors of the bands. You can simply add or subtract links to get the perfect fit. The different links provided means if it breaks, there's plenty of spares. There's no spare clasp pieces, so if they break the clasp, they're done, but the clasps are quite sturdy, the kids have broken a couple of links without breaking the clasps already. They have learned to be aware of the watch on their wrist, so they haven't broken any more links since the first few days (and there's twice as many links as what we need). \n\nOverall, this was a great product that my kids enjoy."

When they get tired of it being the same way they just change the Lego pieces around (which helps them in patterning skills and math) and they have a different watch.  My 8 year old had no issue changing his around but the 6 year old might have touble with this since the peices are tiny and snap tightly in to place (that's what Mom's are for).  This is a great beginner's watch but also large enough for older users.  I wore it and thought it was great as well.  It was very fun to wear, everytime I looked down at it I smiled.  In the day and age of digital mania, it is nice to have something so fun for the children to be able to tell \"regular\" time.  The price was very reasonable especially when the chances of it being lost are very great.  I highly recommend this watch.  I wish they had girl colors"

I had to get a new battery on my own, but as soon as I told Amazon, they credited me the $10. That was great, but they should have sent me a watch in working condition. Otherwise, the watch is highly recommended. Even nicer than in the photo"

      "review_text": "I have owned this watch for over a month now and I can note the following:\n\nThe watch has a diameter of approximately 40mm and is around 10mm thick. Both these number seem average and it looks good on an average size wrist.\n\nThe watch is a bit heavy, but sits comfortably on the wrist. The bracelet rarely pulls the hair, although I have plenty of it.\n\nThe watch is easy to accumulate scratches, but not on the glass. I have scratched the steel around the glass (as well as other places), but the sapphire resists remarkably.\n\nThe time keeping is very accurate, compared to the atomic clock on the web. After a month it has advanced less than half a second ahead, which will result in a six second difference at most per year. I guess results may vary between different watches, but it seems nevertheless impressive and trustworthy enough.\n\nThe timer is very easy to start, stop and reset, with one button pushes. Very fast and convenient.\n\nThe alarm can barely be heard, so is not appropriate for waking. It is useful though for reminders, in a noise free location. Not difficult to set, but takes some time, comparable with setting an alarm on a cell phone. Since it is relative to the secondary time keeping mechanism, you can have a second time zone set and advance the alarm relative to that.\n\nThis watch does not seem to attract special attention to it and has not gained any comments so far, without me bringing it in a conversation. Is pretty conservative, but I personally like that.\n\nThe price of this watch in amazon seems to fluctuate between 100 and 140 dollars. If the price is higher than 130, I would wait a tad, but not hold my breath too long. It is definately worth the money though, since i have seen several Seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years of age and still continue strong. For a dependable, accurate, water proof watch for every occasion, most probably you cannot do better than this"

These earrings catch the light nicely, showing a bit of rainbow effect. They aren't super, super sparkly or faceted, but they do possess shine and detail. I am very happy with these earrings as they are just what I wanted: something petite and real, set in yellow gold, and with a nice, clean and \"believably\" sparkly look!

It is like your everyday watch, but with that BLING look. VERY COOL and VERY JAMES BOND. If you know what I mean. I plan to wear this watch everywhere I go. You should get this one not only because it looks cool but because of the price. You know that $$$ makes up your mind for you"

The timepiece portion appears to be better quality than the jelly strap, which looks very cheap.

Overall my sister, who loves the Little Mermaid, is pleased with this watch. So far she hasn't reported any problems with the timepiece.\n\nFor the price, it's a good value for the timepiece, but I would recommend upgrading the band. The Little Mermaid face is the main reason I purchased this watch, but if you are looking for a good quality timepiece/band, you may consider another watch"

      "review_text": "I'm a regular collector of diving watches and this is one of my favorite ones.  There is something about diving watches that is really attractive though it could be subconscious and because of the fact that you can get it wet and it would still work.  This watch feels rock solid like it just came out from a huge chunk of metal.  For such a quality feel, the price is super amazing.  I would have to go for my Submariner for a similar feel and on some days, I prefer the feel of this than of my Submariner!  The luminated markers are the brightest I ever seen on any watch, diving or non-diving.  Clasp is super-awesome, better than the Submariner.  Bracelet is not as nice looking but ok.  The moveable bezel has the best click of any of the diving watches I own and this is the least expensive dive watch of all but unfortunately I paid a little too much.  The only downside and may not be for you if you don't adjust your bands, but if you do, it's a chore.  I spend hours trying to do this and was only successful after improvising as the linking system is very unusual"

      "reviewer": "Andy Apple",
      "reviewer_location": "Phoenix, AZ USA",
      "review_text": "From the moment you first hold this watch in your hand, you realize it is a quality timepiece. The first thing that strikes you is its large size and heavy feel, yet despite that, it feels comfortable on the wrist due to its fine balance. \n\nBRACELET: \nThe bracelet end links (those that attach to the watch case) are solid rather than formed sheet metal like you will find on most other watches in this price range. The pins holding the bracelet to the watch are the sturdiest I have ever seen. Each of the bracelet's subsequent links is also made from a solid piece of steel, not folded sheet, each component being feather-edged to prevent it digging into the wrist. Its removable link pins are of an unusual machined pin and collar design which, though  fiddly to remove and replace, nevertheless ensure that the pins remain under-flush and secure when correctly installed. The bracelet is perfectly flush on the side that contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear.\nThe clasp is very high quality, having both a fold over security buckle, which deploys with a satisfying click, and an Omega style double button catch. The security buckle closes onto a spring pin whose ends are spherical thus ensuring a tight fastening which should not wear with use. All in all these features add up to a watch that is very quiet on the wrist, the only faint sound coming from its automatic winding mechanism.\nFinally the bracelet incorporates a clever hidden diver's extension (to allow the watch to be worn over a wet suit).\n\nCASE:\nThe watch case, back and bezel are made from stainless steel. The case has an attractive mix of polished, brushed and machined finishes which all add to the feel of quality and function. The overall impression is that this is a precision instrument rather than a fashion piece; that's not to say though that it would look out of place with a dinner jacket any more than a wet suit.\nThe unidirectional bezel is of a heavily scalloped design, protected by bezel-guards which extend upwards from each of the lug pairs. The lower guard also functions as a crown guard and, all in all, the impression is of a case machined from a solid billet of  steel. The bezel sits slightly higher than the domed crystal, thus providing protection from scratching and the crystal itself is of a proprietary Seiko material \"hardlex\" which, as I understand it, is better at resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible to shattering than sapphire.\nThe luminosity of this watch is astounding due partly to the use of Seiko's proprietary \"lumibrite\" paint but also to the large coated areas on the hour markers and hands.\nThe bezel only turns one way, as a safety feature for timing dives, and feels silky smooth, the best I've experienced on any Seiko or Invicta diver. It has 120 clicks per revolution and is nicely aligned with the face.\n\nMOVEMENT:\nThe watch uses the 21 jewel Seiko 7S26 movement running at 21,600 bph (that's 6 ticks per second).  It is non-hacking which means that the second hand does not stop when the crown is pulled out. Although this makes it difficult to synchronize,  if a slight backward pressure is applied to the fully extended crown, it is possible to stop the second hand. The watch can not be hand wound but the self winding mechanism is very efficient and I have found that it has a power reserve of at least 24 hours. The 7S26 has been around for many years and has a reputation for ruggedness and reliability.\n\nACCURACY:\nThere are several reviews where people complain of poor accuracy. Typically, when new, automatic movements will be set to run fast at the factory because they tend to slow down after a few weeks of use. I own three watches with the 7S26 movement and after their breaking in period all are now keeping time to within 10 seconds per day.\nI have a few thoughts on accuracy. You have to ask yourself how accurate does your watch need to be? If it is running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow and you will only need to re-set it once every week or two when it has advanced to one minute fast. If you need more accuracy then, unless you are willing to pay at least five times as much for a swiss watch, then buy a quartz. \n\nFinally, if you do a search on the Seiko Monster you'll quickly come to realize that in its various colours, these watches are firm favourites amongst those who frequent the many watch forums. I would highly recommend that you purchase one and see for yourself!"

The orange face is very legible, and at night, the watch glows almost bright enough to read by!  The clasp is very secure, with a dual button release and an extra clasp to prevent accidental opening.  Day & date are easy to adjust and very readable (much better than my Citizen).  This is a solid performing watch and worth the  money"

I also like having both day and date complications, and to find an automatic watch with these features for less than $300 (way less on Amazon) is really a find.  You will need a pro to adjust the bracelet, though, as each link pin is held in by two tiny bushings that are impossible to replace without the proper jeweler's tools.  Another bother is that the watch gains over a minute a day.  Overall, I really like it.  It's become my daily wear watch."

It has a button aside that is switching between two animation schemes. One: seconds numeric value rotates clockwise on the display; two: seconds drop down in two halfs on the display. Thats all for animation and features in general. No light, no more animations, no stoppers/timers, nothing else; just plain watch.\nFor me, the good looks somewhat compensates the \"thing\" I was originally looking for"

Aside from receiving the unit in a box that was severely damaged as it was drop shipped in its own box,  I have no complaints with it working as advertised. The unit is quite large so you may not want to leave on the counter but the results are SPECTACULAR. It definitely out cleans my Sonic Cleaner.  I have not been able to see a difference between this and the results after I get my jewelry steamed at a large retailer like Fortunoff. I first used it on a G Color VS stones, but it has caused me to start pulling out pieces of lesser quality that I have not worn in ages to give them a revitalizing breath of \"fresh steam\" and I still label the results as SPECTACULAR. I love that I am achieivng these great results with just adding tap water. With my own experimenting, I honestly couldn't tell a difference when using after precleaning pieces in a detergent solution as a competing model - that uses BOTH detergent and distilled water - claims"

The first one lasted about a year before it developed condensation under the glass, then stopped working.  I surf 3-4 times per week and I wasn't rinsing the watch well with fresh water.  I'm guessing that the salt deposits compromised the seal on the watch.\n\nI've had my second one for over a year now and it's like new!

I was very disappointed in Timex and almost didn't buy this one.  This watch is the traditional men's Ironman, but smaller than I had purchased before and it fits nicely on my large wrist with plenty of band length. I have owned the new watch for three months with fairly rugged use and it functions great with easy to operate controls and it is very readable.  My wife and adult children tell me that it looks like a women's watch but I think they are used to oversized wathes that have been in style and I assure them that I am on the cutting edge of a new trend towards smaller (and more reasonally sized) wrist watches for men.  I am happy to say, that once again, I am very pleased with Timex."

      "review_text": "Silver Insanity has the best accessories!!! I saw the image of the ring on Amazon and immediately fell in love. I love rings that covers your proximal phalanx (the bone in your finger closest to your hand). When I received the ring, (earlier than counted upon), I was a little disappointed to see how little it looked and how dainty but that was before I tried it on. I was expecting the ring to be bulky and glad it wasn't. The fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx to the rings slimness. I recommend using the ring size chart b/c I had thought I'd be a 6; turns out, I'm a 7. What was misleading, though, is the picture. The leaves are shown bright, but it looks noticably darker (inside the outer rimming of the leaf, to where the gems are) when you have it in your hands. My fingers are long and slender. The ring didn't twist or turn about, but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely. I'll measure... from the end of the bottom leave to the end of the top, it's about 3.3cm. My middle proximal phalanx (the bone in your middle finger closest to your hand) is about 3.8cm. And if you should run your fingers through your hair, the leaves will not get entangled! Nice!\nYou can wear the damn ring everywhere!!! I love it"

I haven't had any problems with it so far, despite having dropped it twice and worn it outside while working and getting it soaked with sweat multiple times. I don't find it uncomfortable at all and I forget I am wearing it. (I suggest taking it off, the leather band doesn't clean easily like a metal band.) I'm considering buying a second one and keeping it cleaner this time. (Lesson learned."

      "review_text": "I ordered (not from Amazon) a black titanium watch with a black face and white hands (model 530LTMLB, for those of you scoring at home). After an apologetic out-of-stock phone call from the dealer, I settled on what I thought was going to be the same watch but with a white face and black hands (model 530LTMLW, for you precise types). \n\nWhat I got instead was this watch. In the photograph, it looks like dark gray matte metal with a white face. It's not: It's eggshell light gray metal with a mother-of-pearlish face.\n\nI hadn't worn a watch in five years: after all, who needs one in the cell-phone age? (Definitive answer: anyone driving across country with a Sprint cellphone). I took my sweet time selecting a new watch, and got something completely different from what I ordered. I could easily have returned it. Before I did, I slipped in on my wrist to see what it felt like, and promptly forgot that it was there.\n\n(To the nice lady who answered my request for the time with a drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response, can I say that it wasn't actually a pickup line?)\n\nThe titanium thing is not a gimmick: this watch is (obviously) very light indeed, and solid. I have hopes that the light gray colour is undoctored titanium alloy, in which case it will still look good after life deals it some hard knocks. \n\nI set it to the exact (down to the second) correct time when I got it a month ago. It either has a very good movement, or it's secretly communicating with that atomic clock in Colorado without my knowledge.\n\nSome reviewers have complained about a poor latch: I respectfully suggest they don't know how to close it. The watch has a very secure double-latch, which is poorly-explained but is not rocket science - I've added the instructions at the end.\n\nSome complain about noise: this might be a quality-control issue. I can't comment to it because my watch is as quiet as the heartbeat of a fetus.\n(Update several weeks later: The watch is slowly becoming louder, but the loudness changes irregularly, even when the watch is sitting by my bed. It is still very quiet, but but the fact that it is changing does not speak well to long-term durability.)\n\nIt gets 4 stars because I can't tell the time with my glasses off, which is why I wanted a high-contrast watch in the first place. But they're not getting this one back.\n\nLATCH INSTRUCTIONS:\nTo get us properly oriented, lay the watch flat, with the face up. On one end of the strap is the half of the clasp that also contains the strap length adjustment. Open up the clasp part. Next to the strap length adjustment mechanism you will see a plain bar. Now look at the other end of the strap: on the very end of it is a solid, curved clasp. Swing it open, and you will see a wide double hook. \n\nPut the watch on your wrist, and attach the double hook to the plain bar. Next, close the solid clasp until it clicks. Next, close the other clasp over the first one, also until it clicks.\n\nIt is provably impossible for any single brush up against an object (say, an outboard motor) to loosen it"

I was a little concerned about quality because it was so inexpensive for titanium. Though the movement is made in Japan, the rest of the watch is assembled somewhere else, I would assume Hong Kong. The word \"Denmark\" on the face is strictly for style, no part of the watches are made there. Regardless, it seems to be very well made; I've had mine for a year now, and it keeps excellent time and runs reliably. I bought a different Skagen model for my wife at the same time, and hers is just as well made. It has been a great watch and I heartily recommend it.\n\nEDIT: I have been taking swimming lessons, and wearing this watch during them. It has not leaked a drop. I was told it was not suitable for any real depth, such as those encountered while snorkeling or scuba diving, but every other underwater test I've given it, it has passed."

I used the tool to remove and replace the watch pins, just line the pins and squeeze the pliers slowly. The accutron used solid pins and the Swiss Army used pins that looked like they were screws but were pins that are cut or bent in half so always push from the end that looks like a screw head"

I was climbing a straight vertical steel pipe ladder and as I reached the top hatch, which lead to the top landing, my watch face caught on the side of the steel ladder and the band pins broke.

As a fighter pilot (former) I've busted more watches in cockpits than most but this one held up.  Now that I'm in the more sedate confines of an airline cockpit, I still wear it.  It has dual time zones and an alarm, perfect for international travel.  Beware, it's a BIG watch!  If that's not your style, you may want to see one in person before you buy.  The only drawback... the plastic/rubber band will crack after 2+ years and need replacement.  I put a nice leather band on mine and even had a passenger compliment me on my \"Breitling\".  When I told him it was a Casio and cost $4950 less, he wanted one too."

The mechanism is very quiet and the winder looks tidy.\nThe only critisism I have is lack of instructions to mount the watches. Maybe all winders work the same way but this was my first experience with wone and it took a while to work out the watch mounts are spring loaded to accept teh watch band. Once I sorted that out - no problem"

If one reads one of the watch magazines on the market one will quickly find out there are many watch winders out there and most cost a lot of money--in the hundreds to thousands of dollars. This product is in the tens of dollars and works very well.  I am very happy with the product--as well as Amazon (dot) com."

Really liked this watch because of the large readout, ease of use, lap calculation.  I'm a Marathoner and novice Triathlete, so a good, simple, versatile watch is an important piece of equipment for me.  After looking for over a month, I decided to purchase the Timex Triathlon 100 Lap Flix System Watch, and I'm glad I did.  Great readout, easy button control (start and split are much more pronounced - great improvement) and a very sturdy velcro strap makes this a winner for me.  I've already used the timer function with alarm for my swim and bike intervals, and of course the chrono function with splits is easy to read and use.  This is a great watch!"

He saved up for it, and he bought it with his own money after his ADHD and Asperger's self had trouble walking home from the library one too many times when it was time (and after more than a few reminders).  He'd also missed cello lessons at school and was very frustrated with himself for the difficulties he was having.  It is a cool watch.  It looks good, it has two alarms (cello lesson and whatever else he needs) a stop watch and a countdown timer--that he's found a use for so far.  It is waterproof/or resistant, so that means when he forgets to take it off before his bath it's ok.  This watch was a way that he could solve his own problems, and reorganize his own life to make up for some of his difficulties.  That's why I like it so much.\n\nIt has all these features and looks really cool and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg.  That's the best, I think. I'm not sure if he'll ever need the lap timer or the pacing feature or anything like that.  I suppose those features are awesome for those who use them, but for our purposes and our budget, this watch is perfect"

I only use it for running timing, not my everyday watch, but I'll buy one again when I lose this one (as I usually lose them long before they wear out).

Since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized, meaning it's not going to come off.  However the clasp and a few other small parts (watch hands) are made of stainless steel, so they will start losing their finish after awhile.\n\nAfter wearing this watch for a few weeks, I went and put on my old stainless steel Citizen watch.  It felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton.  I went and weighed each of them.  The Citizen came in around 4.5oz, while the Skagen came in at around 1.5oz.  It is also very thin, I used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me, have not had any problems with the Skagen.\n\nOne other thing to note, the picture for this item shows the Steel watch (you can see it on the face), if you want to see a picture of the titanium one, take the product number and go to skagen's site, or google.\n\nThe skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp (not the band)"

It contains the Citizen Miyota 21 jewel automatic movement that is a true workhorse for a fraction of the price.  The comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet is worth the price of the watch. It has rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links The foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins as well. Can easily be mistaken for a watch costing much more.  The Mineral Glass crystal is scratch resistant - but not as good as a sapphire watch face, but is less prone to chipping or shattering than a sapphire crystal. The display watchback is also mineral glass - displaying the undecorated Miyota automatic movement. It look as stylish and run as well as my other watches, and, I receive as many comments if not more from the Invicta's.  It is a great looking watch!  Good value, accurate and stylish if you like the Sub' look. This is a good day-to-day knock about watch that still looks better than the quartz stuff in the same price band. If it lasts 5 years it's more than paid for itself"

Yes, I had to take out about 6 links to get a good fit, but that was fairly easy and only took 5 minutes (which included figuring out how to do it, which I'll explain at the end).\n\nThe clasp locks well - firm, but not difficult to lock/unlock, and is very secure. I was a little suprised with how lightweight the links/band is. That's the only part of the watch that feels a little cheap. Don't get me wrong, it's well constructed, but it's not like a Big Manly Steel Band. At the end of the day, I found that I loved it because it ISN'T heavy.\n\nI didn't give it a full 5 stars because after having it a few weeks there's a teeny tiny scratch that developed on the face/crystal. I'm really cautious and have been gentle with it, so I'm rather disappointed this happened. (And it very possibly might have been me knocking up against a brick wall or something). If you're especially rough on your things, this might not be the best watch for you.\n\nTaking the links out is EASY if you're not completely inept. You'll want something small and sort-of pointy (I happened to have had a filed-down mini screwdriver, but a nail would probably work just as well). I found it easiest to first disconnect the standard clasp - just push the pin in (on either side) and wiggle the clasp apart. Make sure you don't drop/lose the pin. \n\nFor the links, it's fool-proof - it has an arrow engraved on the back of the links, showing you which side the pin/insert comes out. Stick the nail/whatever into the small oval hole and pry the pin out the side. Pull it out with a pair of pliers (it's in there pretty tight) and you can then remove the link"

This string protects you from well....insanity. I unfortunately took off the string and my ring separated into the 4 separate bands. Luckily I found a website that gave me instructions on how to reassemble it. My dad put it back together and it was fine, but I have to admit I'm a little distraut about how there is no indication or warning telling people not to take it off. If this does happen to you, google \"puzzle ring solutions\" and there are many websites to guide you in restoring your ring to normal."

There's only one drawback, it's 8 inches long and that's too long for my wrist. If it fit perfectly, I'd give it ten stars. I'll pay to make it smaller. It's made of titanium, and maybe it's too tough to alter. I want it to fit over that knot on my wrist. If I can get it altered, I'll wear it until the day I die, which I hope will be 100 years from now"

I found that the silver on silver makes it a bit more difficult to read than I would have liked but it's adequate.  Good, accurate movement as the other Invicta timepieces I've owned or known of have also been.  This one is quite heavy and has a feel of a more pricey timepiece.  Mine is running about 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former Invictas I've had were a bit better than this.\n\nUpdate to prior review....  Now that the watch has limbered up, the accuracy has improved and I've hardly needed to touch it"

A couple of small drawbacks:  The pointy edges of the sunshine's rays are kind of sharp and also, the hook part seems to be extra thin because a normal small rubber back does not fit and will slide right off but if you wear the earrings without a rubber back, they will slide out and you will lose them (I know this because I had to backtrack in the grocery store only to find my missing earring in the produce section!).  They DO provide a rubber back that fits but it is so very very tiny that I could easily lose it and it's hard to handle with fingernails.  BUT don't let those things stop you from buying these earrings because they are so distinctive and attractive.  I always get lots of compliments when I wear them"

It is a beautiful timepiece.\n\nWhat can you really say other than what is listed in the specifications. It works just fine, and keeps perfect time.\n\nSo, what is my small criticism? There is a lot of gold and white coloring on the face of the watch, and there is a lot of gold and white on the hands. The problem is that at certain times it is somewhat difficult to distinguish the hands from the background. If you have perfect eyesight this might not be a problem. My eyes are decidedly not perfect. Gone are the days when I can surreptitiously glance at my watch while listening to some boring conversationalist. I generally have to bring the watch to about a foot from my face to read the hands.\n\nStill it is a great watch, and I feel compelled to give it a full five stars"

Since atomic watches adjust automaticaly to and from daylight saving time they are convenient as well as highly accurate. Casio makes -- and Amazon sells -- a wide selection of styles of atomic watches to suit various needs and tastes, including G-Shock watches for extra ruggedness and solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries. But all atomic watches, including this budget-priced Waveceptor model, are equally accurate to a fraction of a second at all times.

It sets itself daily and even uses WWV's \"leap year\" flag so you don't have to worry about the Daylight Savings time change.\n\nIt is a bit fussy here in Pittsburgh (hill country). It took a bit of experimentation to find some place to sit it overnight where it will get a good signal. It instructs in the manual to sit it near a window with the \"six\" on the watch pointed at the window and to let it sit for up to 10 minutes.\n\nI followed the manual instructions several times. Then I picked up the watch right after I initiated the manual search for the signal. I moved it around until it showed a steady \"3\" (highest signal level). Problem solved.\n\nAdjusting the band should be as simple as looking for the arrows and pusing out the pin, etc. Except it require brute force. I broke a jeweler's screwdriver and small punch in the process.\n\nI should have bought an expansion band at the same time"

It looks great, does everything that you would expect, and is a joy to look at - I've swapped it for a watch that my wife bought me for a wedding present \"just to get used to it for a bit\" (which obviously she's less than pleased about), and everytime I look at it I see a really great watch that I'm really pleased I bought.\n\nHOWEVER, if there was a design fault, it would be this: when you start and then stop the stop watch, you cannot reset without pressing and holding the reset button; surely it would be better for a one-touch reset?  Also, with the Timer - loop 3 (which is continuous countdown) the reset button (again press and hold) resets the timer to zero (as you would expect the 'set' button to do), and the set button (press and hold) resets the timer to the original timer setting (eg 5 mins) - surely these are the wrong way round?  All a bit odd, but sort-of OK once you get used to it.  Seems a bit sloppy though in its design.\n\nNonetheless, overall an excellent watch.  I'm really please I bought it and it's very useful for triathlon events, using the lap on the stopwatch"

      "review_text": "I'm a wristwatch fan, and I have a modest collection of nice luxury watches, and I was looking for something inexpensive that I could use for \"rough\" activities where I don't want to damage my nicer Omega or Rolex watches. I wanted something with sport functions and alarm.\n\nMost sports watches with digital displays (e.g. Casio or even other Timex Ironmans) are pretty ugly, they look out of place wearing anything but sweats and sneakers. But I was pleasantly surprised by this Timex model. You can turn off the digital display and it looks like a reasonable handsome analog watch, but one press and the display functions appear again. However, there are some drawbacks:\n- the digits can be hidden by the thick hands of the analog display.\n- The white on black digital display isn't very clear except in good light. You'll be using the Indiglo backlight often.\n\nThe rest of the watch is pretty nice overall. The cidg is heavy, and thick but thanks to the comfortable rubber band, I don't find the watch annoying on my small wrist. The loop on the band to hold the end of the band secure stays put pretty well. The overall weight is hefty but not as overbearing as some other watches with metal straps. The finish isn't exactly Rolex quality, it looks like what you expect a $50 watch, the brushing is a bit uneven. The design is modern and smooth, and the watch looks a bit more expensive than it is.\n\nThe functions of the watch are pretty typical of any digital watch. There isn't anything about the watch I find confusing. As long as you walk through the functions once in the manual, you shouldn't have problems doing it again later without the manual. Usually you have to hold the top left button to go into set modes, and the other buttons go up/down or advance the setting mode. I could completely figure out the watch without the manual. \n\nAs for the sport functions, the three loop countdown timers allow you to set up intervals. For example, you can one loop to time running interval, and then a second loop for the walk break. The chrono function keeps track of 42 laps, and you can see each lap time in the recall mode. However, because the hands can easily cover the digits, I wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need to be able to read the digits at all times, stick with a digital only Ironman model\n\nThe Indiglo backlight just adds enough light to the digits to allow you to see the light in any lighting condition, but as I said, you'll more likely to use it in this watch because of the low contrast of the digits. The Alarm is average for a digital watch, it is good enough to wake most people when placed on the bedside (it isn't very loud worn on the wirst)"

It looks great, but the rubber will wear out and break in about a year. The replacement band that Casio offers looks close the orginal, but not exactly the same. I lost one of these, and another was stolen. So the fact that I am on my third is a statement to how much I love this watch. I have been wearing it since about 1993"

Shipping and handling was very reasonable also. Here is some information on Hematite and why it is one of my favorite stones:\nHematite: Element Earth \nChakras: Root (1st)\nHematite is the most effective of all stones for grounding oneself in the body and physical world. It can counteract spaciness and confusion, helping one to see the practical concerns and move forward with useful action. Hematite can be used to balance the auric field and align the chakras. It pulls stray energies down through the meridian sytem to the root chakra. Hematite can help one see the silver lining on every dark cloud and the light at the end of every tunnel. It lends one strength, courage and fortitude for moving through adversity. It is excellent for energetic support of recovery from any ailment of the blood and of blood production within bone marrow. It can work as a strengthener for the liver and can assist in the detoxification process."

It is a really nice peice:  perfect for both casual and formal wear.  The only things I did not like are that the bracelet is not totally cylindrical (it is flat on one side) and some of the links are welded together (not that this really matters because no one can see this).  However, compared to the byzantine bracelet I had had in the past, it is fantastic.  That one kept breaking apart any time it got caught on anything because the rings were not welded closed.  The fact that these are (even if some are welded together) is a fantastic feature"

      "review_text": "I own about 27 various expensive brands of quartz watches and finally decided it was time to invest in an automatic. I knew stories from other people who own them and claim that it's important to have a good watch winder, so, I saw this one and decided I'd give it a try. I could not see the point in spending hundreds of dollars on a winder when I could use that money towards another watch! :)   I ordered this before I even received my new Invicta Automatic Pro Diver watch.\nI have very tiny wrists, and because of that, at first I did not think the spring loader was going to work for me. I struggled a bit to fit my watch in the holder but after about 15 minutes, I got it.  I have been using the watch winder off and on now for over a week and I think it does a great job. My automatic is only 1 minute fast, and although I'm not sure if that speaks more for the quality of the watch or the winder, all I can say is I think the product is doing what it is supposed to do and the watch is keeping time well.\nI put it on the winder each night before bed. It's fairly quiet but that is just my opinion. I have read other reviews where people said it was loud. I expected it to be louder than it is.\nLike other reviewers, I am unsure of how much is \"too much\" winding. I think most watches have a built in mechanism that prevents overwinding so I guess putting it in the winder each night is ok.\nMy only problem now is the lonely empty space where another automatic needs to be since it is a double winder. Hmmmm......time to get another watch!    :)   If you need a winder, get this. It works well and you can save the extra money and get yourself another watch to add to your collection"

It's very quiet and the interval winding keeps his watches running without risking over-winding. \n\nYou can save a lot of money by forgoing the leather wrapping or wood veneer packaging on the more expensive winders and just get this one."

So the digital part of the watch is useless at night (if incase you happen to be doing something in the dark, at night).This is the only disappointing fact about the wrist watch.            You might think a watch that cost $60 will have a self supplied light, but it does not. SAD. SHAME ON CASIO. Apart from that, i love the watch"

Nothing was damaged, and the chain and little black pouch was well picked. It was a surprise pendant for my girlfriend, she expected just one item, but this moon was well priced, so I bought it with another pendant. You are lucky to get such beautifully crafted art at this price. It is strong, so no need to worry about breakage during shiping.\nI like it, and wish I could keep it, but it was a gift."

All pearls are more or less same size. Beautiful clasps too. However I have to agree with the previous reviewer that it is hard to handle without help, especially the bracelet. Took me about 10 minutes to put it on my wrist. The color is slightly yellowish. The shape is good: kinda semiround rather than potato. They'll make great gifts."

Winds my Rolexes and a few other ETA autos perfectly, but it doesn't seem to keep my Seiko kinetic diver or Panerais wound sufficiently. Still, as far as I'm concerned, it spreads the lubrication enough to keep the watches in good health. For the price point, this winder cannot be beat and I will purchase more in the future. The auto timer keeps the winder running cool. Fairly silent rotation, depending on the watch. While the gear rotations themselves are completely silent, sometimes there's a slight shift of the watch as it goes around, which makes a repetitive sound. Nothing I can't live with. Highly recommended"

      "review_text": "This is a sleek, sharp, quality watch, and the lowest priced model that I've seen in the arctura series. If you can catch it on sale, I think its a great buy. However, be prepared for the weight. This is the heaviest watch I've ever worn, and probably the largest. If you're used to wearing stainless watches, it will probably be fine for you. I'm used to leather bands, and the weight difference is quite noticeable. Wish I could find this watch in titanium, that would be perfect. Overall, if you're not bothered by the large size or weight, it looks great, and I'm sure the quality is also."

The only problem we encountered was w/ the so-called \"smart link\" band.  It was supposedly designed for the customer to resize the band at home, but after numerous failed attempts, we gave up. We Googled it and found several people who encountered similar problems solving the smart link mystery but no one offered a solution. Even the Fossil website was no help. We ended up paying a jeweler who sells Fossil watches $10 to resize the band.  Other than that, my husband is very satisfied with this watch."

      "review_text": "I wanted an automatic watch for a while, and I was attracted to the green trim on this model. The watch is big and heavy. This is probably true of most automatics. My issue is that it seems to be too thick. I think the glass/crystal back adds a millimeter or so. \nThe band has a slight problem that I can probably fix. Right where the metal of the band contacts the case, one side of the band has bent slightly causing the band to interfere with the rotating bezel. I may have caused this when adjusting the linkage, or it may have come delivered that way. I think I could simply detach the band and squeeze it back into its proper shape. I have actually left it alone as I do not want the bezel to rotate, and the defect is not visible.\nAs far as accuracy, it seems to have gained about 20-30sec in a week. \nHad I seen the watch in a store and tried it on, I would probably not have bought it. I was not happy when it arrived, but I have worn it for a week, and I am now glad that I picked it.\nThe only other issue is that I wish the luminous markings were brighter. I purposely picked the black face to be easier to see the markings in the dark (as opposed to the white face), but I have had better luck with other watches"

I have always admired automatic watches, someday when I can afford one I will purchase an Omega or Rolex.\n\nI can tell that in my particular watch there is a minute dust on the hour hand and on the pendulum.\n\nFirst off, this watch should be appreciated for what it is, an automatic watch for a reasonable price.  There are no batteries, no electronics, just gears and springs.  Some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use a pendulum to charge a small battery, these do not interest me.\n\nPros:  automatic movement, sharp visual appeal, day/date function, supposed shock resistance (haven't beat it up enough to know if this is true but I trust the claim having researched the manufacturing of the movement).  See-thru case back so you can watch the mechanism do its thing!\n\nCons:  It is not a Rolex, so don't expect perfection.  The band and case are solid but lack the heft, fit and finish of a Rolex level watch.\n\nBottom Line:  If you want a truly automatic watch for about 100 bucks this is a great choice.  Orient watches and other Invicta models are supposedly are just as good.  You will get compliments on this watch"

Collins and the watch automatically syncs every night, even if I don't put it near a window.\n\nSolar recharge.  The watch arrived with a low battery.  It charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon.  Since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part.\n\nThe watch is big and heavy.  I take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand.\n\nThe watch's user interface is unintuitive.  This is the first watch I've owned where I had to read (and re-read) the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm. I find the Timex interface and the old-style Casio interface much easier to use.\n\nIn the interests of saving battery power, the alarms are short and quiet.  I can't count on this watch's alarms to wake me up.  It'd be nice if the watch had a power-hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations.\n\nAll in all, I like the watch.  It is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn't run out of batteries.  I wish the user interface was more intuitive, the alarms were more effective, and the watch was smaller"

So now I have two atomic watches, but the G-shock is superior by far and is ruggedly sturdy and should last indefinately with the solar power, just be sure to get it to full charge by putting it in direct sunlight until it indicates full charge.

The time stamp feature is great for when I need help remember when a specific event happened.  As for the solar power.  It's great in that you don't have to worry about batteries, but most watch batteries last close to five years anyway.  In the Army I find myself doing lots of night missions, and I can go months without seeing the sun because I have to catch up on sleep during the day.  Well, this doesn't really work with a solar powered watch.  I get by, but it can be a hassle some times.  All-in-all, this is a great watch, and if you don't work at night then the solar power won't be a problem for you, except maybe in the winter when you wear coats that cover your wrist.  Just take that into consideration when purchidg a solar powered watch"

I wear mine all day, every day, even in the pool or shower, and it's held up well. The light did go out seemingly \"too soon\" but then I notice the battery was beginning to fade as well at the same time. I wear mine all day, every day, in pool and shower, and it's held up remarkably well. The only negative is that it seems the battery goes quickly ... but maybe that's due to using the alarm daily and training with it. \n\nIt is an inexpensive watch (compared to many other options that are out there) and given its ease of use, its very readable face, and sleek look, I'd take the chance on it"

It looks very masculine and classy, and the style will certainly age well. The slide rule takes a little figuring out, but it's very useful. It keeps time pretty well, too. I've only got a couple of complaints:\n\nThe leather band, which I picked because metal bands have always been uncomfortable for me, is a little too large for my wrist. Even when I use the innermost hole in the band, the watch is still kind of floppy. \n\nFor the price, the watch could have a sapphire crystal instead of a glass one. \n\nThose conplaints are very minor compared to everything I like about the watch. I didn't want to give the watch five stars if I had complaints about it, but my rating would probably be more like 4.75 stars. For the price, it's a great value."

The animated feature is simply the face switching between red and black which can be set to hold at either color, which is a feature I have found to to very fuctional as it allows for me to switch to the color that better complitments what I am wearing. I have had this watch for nearly a year and it still gets comlpiments weekly. My only criticism comes from the fact that it is not like some of more of the trend watches that have a wide band that actually cuff around the entire wrist, from which this watch takes its styling cues. Nevertheless, it is still a great watch that looks good"

It is accurate enough to get me to work on time.  I do have to wind it about once every week or two, mainly because I don't move my arm enough, I think.  Note that this watch is fairly big (on me anyway) and the strap is quite stiff when new.  It has started to loosen up now that I have had it for a while.  I like the look, and I think it is dressy enough to wear with a suit, but still casual enough that it doesn't look out of place with jeans either.  A reasonable price for a decent watch"

      "review_text": "My reaction is quite similar to the other reviewer.  I received my watch a few weeks ago (only took three days) and was impressed by its classy look---all my other casios have been basic black clunkers.  I like that the toggle switches protrude, so it's easy to activate them---those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying to get a nail or golf tee in there. It has all the features I wanted, but I had the same reaction about the alarm.  It's less assertive than the other casios I've had, and I don't think I can trust it to wake me up early or if I'm tired. I've already decided to buy an inexpensive alarm to put by my bed.  Because the screen showing the digital data is small, it's not always easy to read what's on it, especially if the watch hand is partially obscuring the screen, which somehow seems to happen a lot.  The back light only goes on one second at a time, and isn't very strong, so there's a good chance that you won't be able to read the digital screen that quickly.  FYI, the 10 year battery claim is based on using one second of backlight each day, so you better look quick and look sharp----but not often.  So.......great looks, but personality could be better.  That's life"

The silver is clean and smooth looking just like the pictures.  Due to the size of the locket, a dainty, smaller chain is sturdy but does not detract from the locket.  Therefore, while I was concerned about the chain size and negative reviews, I took a risk and am happy with this purchase.  The pictures were easy to insert and there is a plastic film to put over the pictures for finger prints and some protection.\nGood gift.\nSincerely,\nThe guy who usually blows it on the Valentine's Day gift."

What's not to like? Wouldn't mind having a light on the LCD, otherwise it is proven a great investment.\n\nBattery lasts ~2 years with the alarm going off every day and watch band life is about the same (cracks develop after a while). No corrosion (duh, stainless steel) and good resistance to scratches on the crystal so far."

Now onto the timekeeping.When I received the watch it ran a bit fast (30 sec. daily) so instead of waiting the 6 weeks to sent it to Seiko for repair, I took it to the local Seiko dealership/jeweler and had them regulate it for $30, well worth the money and now it runs great. This watch is an absolute tank, I wear it every day, it gets banged around quite a bit, and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal."

It's cheap feeling and loose. The center links are fold-over, NOT solid. At this price though, it's not surprising that something got cheaped out like that.\n\nOverall, I give it a 4-star rating. Missing tag!!! False advertising (perhaps to the benefit, as the 009K is perceived a little better) that it's really a SKX009K rather than a SKX175 (has Singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface, whereas the SKX009K does not have any country markings). Great buy for sure!!\n\ncheers"

It doesnt have any user guide but if you have used tools then you will be able to figure out where to use what and how.  The quality of products is pretty good too .. at least nothing broke during fixing 5-6 watches yet.\n\nI am very happy with the purchase.
